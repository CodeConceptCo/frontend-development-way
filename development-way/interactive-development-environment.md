## 3. Interactive development environment

Usually, it's impossible to create documentation or some demos of the components and tutorials how to use them to help other developers on the project or who will work after you. To fix this use Interactive development environment.



[Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components. Storybook runs outside of your app. This allows you to develop UI components in isolation, which can improve component reuse, testability, and development speed. You can build quickly without having to worry about application-specific dependencies. 

Storybook support React, React Native, Vue, Angular, HTML, Polymer, Marko and Svelte.



For Angular 1 use [SB](https://github.com/ui-storybook/sb) 



Benefits: 

-   Keep your code auto documented 
-   Get the demo of all application components hassle free
-   Simplify onboarding for new developers
